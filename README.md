This will open the Jupyter environment in your browser. You can then execute the cells in the notebook to see the code in action.

### ü§ñ Model Training

The `Ransomware_Traffic_Classification_Model.ipynb` notebook contains all the steps to load, preprocess, and train the models. The notebook outlines the encoding of categorical data and the evaluation of each model's performance.

To retrain the model, simply run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook after ensuring the prerequisites are met. [cite_start]The script will generate a `ransomware_classification_report.pdf` file with the results[cite: 1].
