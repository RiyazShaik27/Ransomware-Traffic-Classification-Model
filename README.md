### ✨ Features

This project leverages machine learning to detect ransomware activity in network traffic. Key features include:
- [cite_start]**Data Preprocessing:** The model processes a dataset with columns such as `Time`, `Protcol`, `Family`, `Netflow_Bytes`, and `Prediction` to prepare it for training[cite: 2].
- **Model Comparison:** The project compares the performance of two distinct machine learning models:
    - [cite_start]**Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of **1.00** on the test set[cite: 1].
    - [cite_start]**Neural Network**: Achieved an accuracy of **0.89** on the test set[cite: 1].
- [cite_start]**Comprehensive Reporting:** A detailed PDF report is generated, including classification reports, confusion matrices, and model accuracy comparisons[cite: 1].

### 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### ✅ Prerequisites

Before running this project, you will need to have the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Essential Python libraries for data science

### 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/ransomware-classification.git](https://github.com/yourusername/ransomware-classification.git)
    cd ransomware-classification
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Launch the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Ransomware_Traffic_Classification_Model.ipynb
    ```

This will open the Jupyter environment in your browser. You can then execute the cells in the notebook to see the code in action.

### 🤖 Model Training

The `Ransomware_Traffic_Classification_Model.ipynb` notebook contains all the steps to load, preprocess, and train the models. The notebook outlines the encoding of categorical data and the evaluation of each model's performance.

To retrain the model, simply run all cells in the Jupyter Notebook after ensuring the prerequisites are met. [cite_start]The script will generate a `ransomware_classification_report.pdf` file with the results[cite: 1].

### 📝 Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by the need for robust network security solutions.
