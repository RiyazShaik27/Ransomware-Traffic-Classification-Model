### ✨ Features

This project leverages machine learning to detect ransomware activity in network traffic. Key features include:
- [cite_start]**Data Preprocessing:** The model processes a dataset with columns such as `Time`, `Protcol`, `Family`, `Netflow_Bytes`, and `Prediction` to prepare it for training[cite: 2].
- **Model Comparison:** The project compares the performance of two distinct machine learning models:
    - [cite_start]**Random Forest Classifier**: Achieved an accuracy of **1.00** on the test set[cite: 1].
    - [cite_start]**Neural Network**: Achieved an accuracy of **0.89** on the test set[cite: 1].
- [cite_start]**Comprehensive Reporting:** A detailed PDF report is generated, including classification reports, confusion matrices, and model accuracy comparisons[cite: 1].
